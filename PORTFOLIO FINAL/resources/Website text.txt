About Me

I am a 20 year old girl, born in Chicago, IL. I am studying to one day become a creative director at a fashion media agency. I am in the Media School at Indiana University Bloomington. Before that, I attended a Jesuit High School where I learned the importance of giving back to my community and the joy of trying new things. I've worked as a Brand Representative at Abercrombie and Fitch for three years, and I am hoping to work as a Graphic Design Intern for a women-owned business that represents a curated selection of leading furniture and textile manufacturers. 

News page

Project 1: Produce a modular layout news page from a choice of five stories, with a clear focal point story, strong page structure with consistent spacing and text flow, graphical elements, and well-scaled typography. 

The design decisions for the news page were carefully made to balance both readability and visual impact. The focal point being, "Poison in the Well," ensured immediate attention to this investigative piece, which we deemed most critical. The paragraph styles were intentionally varied to enhance clarity and reader engagement. 

It was challenging to space the body text correctly without seeming to overflow. So, for revision purposes, I made the headline in the Crestwood story closer to the photo and made the subtext smaller to ensure no overflow. I also made the type more readable in each section so it didn't look too cluttered. Lastly, I changed the Coffee Promo to be more cohesive in the Promos section.  

Magazine

Project 2: Produce a prototype of a new graphic design magazine, an edition of “Three Six Five” magazine, with a cover, ASF page, opening spread, and second spread of a story. 

In this assignment, I researched Giacometti’s work to depict what he was trying to achieve. I blended his style into a style of my own, using colors that represent London and images that I believed showed his style off. On the cover, I decided to use a different image because I felt the magazine needed to have more of an art vibe. The image shows a figure that looks kind of like a sculpture, so choosing that blended well with using Alberto Giacometti’s story especially. 

Personally, this was my favorite project this semester because I was able to design it in my own way. That meant choosing my own photos, fonts, and artistic elements. It was very fun to bring my own design style out in the project and show off what I had learned up until this moment. In terms of revision, I absolutely loved the design I made, so the only thing I changed was the choice of color for my folios. 

Infographic 

Project 3: Create an infographic using compelling and appropriate information, including choice of color and typography, visual consistency, and creative use of placed images. We were to produce a selection of chart types and include an engaging display of at least two well-structured and informative charted elements. 

Upon reflection, this infographic regarding the development of music formats in the United States captures the dynamic changes in consumer tastes over the previous half-century. It centers on the surprising comeback of vinyl records, the prior domination of cassette tapes, and the market dominance of CDs in the 1990s. The data's key findings show that CDs, which reflect many eras of music history, had the biggest market share (42.12%), followed by vinyl (30.13%) and cassettes (27.75%). 

The infographic's design effectively conveys these changes by combining a pie chart that shows total market share with a bar chart that shows annual sales patterns. This multi-layered strategy successfully conveys how both cultural trends and technological advancements impacted each format's popularity. Despite the digital age, vinyl's comeback is especially noteworthy, indicating a cultural trend back toward real experiences. 

Poster 

Project 4: Create a poster that advertises an event, real or fictional, using illustration, type design, and the principles of design we studied in class. 

Through a combination of essential branding components including the recognizable pink hues, glitter texture, and striped pattern, all of which express elegance, femininity, and luxury, this design masterfully portrays the spirit of the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. Feathers and wings successfully connect to the brand's "Angel" symbol, and the silhouette of Adriana Lima was perfect for this design. I wanted to include a full silhouette instead of the cutoff to represent that "catwalk" look with the glitter in the background. There is always a glittering catwalk at the shows, so I wanted to replicate that part. 

This project did not turn out the way I originally envisioned it. I believed that my project was advertising that "girly" vibe and would attract those who automatically think "Victoria's Secret." I definitely should have put more thought into the creative aspect, as well as giving myself a chance to turn this "girly" idea into something of my own. I did keep most aspects the same in the revisions I made, but now I believe I have made it more of my own. As I said, I did love this design, but as much as I love it, it wasn't exactly what the project wanted me to do. If I had to go back, I would have thought of a more creative way to advertise Victoria's Secret in a different way.
